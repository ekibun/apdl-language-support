Can be used for nonlinear and linear analyses, especially nonlinear analysis where indefinite matrices are frequently encountered. Well suited for contact analysis where contact status alters the mesh topology. Other typical well-suited applications are: (a) models consisting of shell/beam or shell/beam and solid elements (b) models with a multi-branch structure, such as an automobile exhaust or a turbine fan. This is an alternative to iterative solvers since it combines both speed and robustness. Generally, it requires considerably more memory (~10x) than the PCG solver to obtain optimal performance (running totally in-core). When memory is limited, the solver works partly in-core and out-of-core, which can noticeably slow down the performance of the solver. See the [BCSOPTION](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_BCSOPTION.html) command for more details on the various modes of operation for this solver.\n\nThis solver can be run in shared memory parallel or distributed memory parallel (Distributed ANSYS) mode.

The total sum of memory (summed for all processes) is usually higher than the shared memory sparse solver. System configuration also affects the performance of the distributed memory parallel solver. If enough physical memory is available, running this solver in the in-core memory mode achieves optimal performance. The ideal configuration when using the out-of-core memory mode is to use one processor per machine on multiple machines (a cluster), spreading the I/O across the hard drives of each machine, assuming that you are using a high-speed network such as Infiniband to efficiently support all communication across the multiple machines. \n\nThis solver supports use of the [GPU accelerator capability](ans_dan/para_gpu.html)."},{"match":"JCG","detail":"Jacobi Conjugate Gradient iterative equation solver.

Applicable to real-value or complex-value symmetric and unsymmetric matrices. Available only for STATIC, HARMIC (full method only), TRANS (full method only), SUBSTR, and PSD spectrum analysis types [[ANTYPE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_ANTYPE.html)]. Can be used for nonlinear and linear analyses, especially nonlinear analysis where indefinite matrices are frequently encountered. Well suited for contact analysis where contact status alters the mesh topology. Other typical well-suited applications are: (a) models consisting of shell/beam or shell/beam and solid elements (b) models with a multi-branch structure, such as an automobile exhaust or a turbine fan. This is an alternative to iterative solvers since it combines both speed and robustness. Generally, it requires considerably more memory (~10x) than the PCG solver to obtain optimal performance (running totally in-core). When memory is limited, the solver works partly in-core and out-of-core, which can noticeably slow down the performance of the solver.

The total sum of memory (summed for all processes) is usually higher than the shared memory sparse solver. System configuration also affects the performance of the distributed memory parallel solver. If enough physical memory is available, running this solver in the in-core memory mode achieves optimal performance. The ideal configuration when using the out-of-core memory mode is to use one processor per machine on multiple machines (a cluster), spreading the I/O across the hard drives of each machine, assuming that you are using a high-speed network such as Infiniband to efficiently support all communication across the multiple machines. \n\nThis solver supports use of the [GPU accelerator capability](ans_dan/para_gpu.html).\n\n**JCG**\n\n—\n\nJacobi Conjugate Gradient iterative equation solver.

Value is ignored."},{"match":"DEFA","detail":"Set all MOPT options to default values. Value is ignored."}],"detail":"Meshing option to be specified (determines the meaning of Value): \n\n**AORDER**\n\n—\n\nMesh by ascending area size order. Set Value to ON to mesh smaller areas first. Using this results in finer meshes in critical areas for volume meshes; this can be used for cases where [SMRTSIZE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_SMRTSIZE.html) does not mesh as needed. Default is OFF.\n\n**EXPND**\n\n—\n\nArea mesh expansion (or contraction) option. (This option is the same as [SMRTSIZE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_SMRTSIZE.html),,,EXPND.) This option is used to size internal elements in an area based on the size of the elements on the area's boundaries. \n\nValue is the expansion (or contraction) factor. For example, issuing MOPT,EXPND,2 before meshing an area will allow a mesh with elements that are approximately twice as large in the interior of an area as they are on the boundary. If Value is less than 1, a mesh with smaller elements on the interior of the area will be allowed. Value for this option should be greater than 0.5 but less than 4. \n\nValue defaults to 1, which does not allow expansion or contraction of internal element sizes (except when using [AESIZE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_AESIZE.html) sizing). If Value = 0, the default value of 1 will be used. The actual size of the internal elements will also depend on the TRANS option (or upon [AESIZE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_AESIZE.html) or [ESIZE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_ESIZE.html) sizing, if used).\n\n**TETEXPND**\n\n—\n\nTet-mesh expansion (or contraction) option. This option is used to size internal elements in a volume based on the size of the elements on the volume's boundaries. \n\nValue is the expansion (or contraction) factor. For example, issuing MOPT,TETEXPND,2 before meshing a volume will allow a mesh with elements that are approximately twice as large in the interior of the volume as they are on the boundary. If Value is less than 1, a mesh with smaller elements on the interior of the volume will be allowed. Value for this option should be greater than 0.1 but less than 3. \n\nValue defaults to 1, which does not allow expansion or contraction of internal element sizes. If Value = 0, the default value of 1 will be used. If Value is greater than 2, mesher robustness may be affected. \n\nThe TETEXPND option is supported for both the [VMESH](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_VMESH.html) and [FVMESH](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_FVMESH.html) commands. Tet-mesh expansion is the only mesh control supported by [FVMESH](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_FVMESH.html).\n\n**TRANS**\n\n—\n\nMesh-transition option. Controls how rapidly elements are permitted to change in size from the boundary to the interior of an area. (This option performs the same operation as [SMRTSIZE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_SMRTSIZE.html),,,,TRANS.) \n\nValue is the transitioning factor. Value defaults to 2.0, which permits elements to approximately double in size as they approach the interior of the area. (If Value = 0, the default value of 2 will be used.) Value must be greater than 1 and, for best results, should be less than 4. The actual size of the internal elements will also depend on the EXPND option (or upon [AESIZE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_AESIZE.html) or [ESIZE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_ESIZE.html) sizing, if used).\n\nFor a quad mesh with any element size, this option has no effect, as the program strictly respects any face size to ensure the most uniform quad mesh possible. To obtain a graded mesh using this option, apply [LESIZE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_LESIZE.html) to the lines of the desired face.\n\n**AMESH**\n\n—\n\nTriangle surface-meshing option. Valid inputs for Value are: \n\n**DEFAULT**\n\n—\n\nAllows the program to choose which triangle mesher to use. In most cases, the program chooses the main triangle mesher, which is the Riemann space mesher. If the chosen mesher fails for any reason, the program invokes the alternate mesher and retries the meshing operation.\n\n**MAIN**\n\n—\n\nThe program uses the main triangle mesher (Riemann space mesher), and it does not invoke an alternate mesher if the main mesher fails. The Riemann space mesher is well suited for most surfaces.\n\n**ALTERNATE**\n\n—\n\nThe program uses the first alternate triangle mesher (3-D tri-mesher), and it does not invoke another mesher if this mesher fails. This option is not recommended due to speed considerations. However, for surfaces with degeneracies in parametric space, this mesher often provides the best results.\n\n**ALT2**\n\n—\n\nThe program uses the second alternate triangle mesher (2-D parametric space mesher), and it does not invoke another mesher if this mesher fails. This option is not recommended for use on surfaces with degeneracies (spheres, cones, etc.) or poorly parameterized surfaces because poor meshes may result.\n\n**QMESH**\n\n—\n\nQuadrilateral surface meshing option. (Quadrilateral surface meshes will differ based on which triangle surface mesher is selected. This is true because all free quadrilateral meshing algorithms use a triangle mesh as a starting point.) Valid inputs for Value are: \n\n**DEFAULT**\n\n—\n\nLet the program choose which quadrilateral mesher to use. In most cases, the program will choose the main quadrilateral mesher, which is the Q-Morph (quad-morphing) mesher. For very coarse meshes, the program may choose the alternate quadrilateral mesher instead. In most cases, the Q-Morph mesher results in higher quality elements. If either mesher fails for any reason, the program invokes the other mesher and retries the meshing operation. (Default.)\n\n**MAIN**\n\n—\n\nThe program uses the main quadrilateral mesher (Q-Morph mesher), and it does not invoke the alternate mesher if the main mesher fails.\n\n**ALTERNATE**\n\n—\n\nThe program uses the alternate quadrilateral mesher, and it does not invoke the Q-Morph mesher if the alternate mesher fails. To use the alternate quadrilateral mesher, you must also select MOPT,AMESH,ALTERNATE or MOPT,AMESH,ALT2.\n\n**VMESH**\n\n—\n\nTetrahedral element meshing option. Valid inputs for Value are: \n\n**DEFAULT**\n\n—\n\nLet the program choose which tetrahedra mesher to use. \n\n**MAIN**\n\n—\n\nUse the main tetrahedra mesher (Delaunay technique mesher). (GHS3D meshing technology by P. L. George, INRIA, France.) For most models, this mesher is significantly faster than the alternate mesher.\n\n**ALTERNATE**\n\n—\n\nUse the alternate tetrahedra mesher (advancing front mesher). This mesher does not support the generation of a tetrahedral volume mesh from facets ([FVMESH](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_FVMESH.html)). If this mesher is selected and you issue the [FVMESH](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_FVMESH.html) command, the program uses the main tetrahedra mesher to create the mesh from facets and issues a warning message to notify you.\n\n**SPLIT**\n\n—\n\nQuad splitting option for non-mapped meshing. If Value = 1, ON, or ERR, quadrilateral elements in violation of shape error limits are split into triangles (default). If Value = 2 or WARN, quadrilateral elements in violation of either shape error or warning limits are split into triangles. If Value = OFF, splitting does not occur, regardless of element quality.\n\n**LSMO**\n\n—\n\nLine smoothing option. Value can be ON or OFF. If Value = ON, smoothing of nodes on area boundaries is performed during smoothing step of meshing. During smoothing, node locations are adjusted to achieve a better mesh. If Value = OFF (default), no smoothing takes place at area boundaries.\n\n**CLEAR**\n\n—\n\nThis option affects the element and node numbering after clearing a mesh. If Value = ON (default), the starting node and element numbers will be the lowest available number after the nodes and elements are cleared. If Value = OFF, the starting node and element numbers are not reset after the clear operation.\n\n**PYRA**\n\n—\n\nTransitional pyramid elements option. Value can be ON or OFF. If Value = ON (default), the program automatically creates transitional pyramid elements, when possible. Pyramids may be created at the interface of tetrahedral and hexahedral elements, or directly from quadrilateral elements. For pyramids to be created, you must also issue the command [MSHAPE](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_MSHAPE.html),1,3D (degenerate 3-D elements). If Value = OFF, the program does not create transitional pyramid elements.\n\n**TIMP**\n\n—\n\nIdentifies the level of tetrahedra improvement to be performed when the next free volume meshing operation is initiated ([VMESH](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_VMESH.html), [FVMESH](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_FVMESH.html)). (For levels 2-5, improvement occurs primarily through the use of face swapping and node smoothing techniques.) Valid inputs for Value are: \n\n**0**\n\n—\n\nTurn off tetrahedra improvement. Although this value can lead to faster tetrahedral mesh creation, it is not recommended because it often leads to poorly shaped elements and mesh failures.\n\n**1**\n\n—\n\nDo the minimal amount of tetrahedra improvement. (Default.) This option is supported by the main tetrahedra mesher only [MOPT,VMESH,MAIN]. If the alternate tetrahedra mesher (MOPT,VMESH,ALTERNATE) is invoked with this setting, the program automatically performs tetrahedra improvement at level 3 instead (MOPT,TIMP,3).\n\n**2**\n\n—\n\nPerform the least amount of swapping/smoothing. No improvement occurs if all tetrahedral elements are within acceptable limits.\n\n**3**\n\n—\n\nPerform an intermediate amount of swapping/smoothing.

Meshing takes longer with this level of improvement, but usually results in a better mesh.\n\n**5**\n\n—\n\nPerform the greatest amount of swapping/smoothing, plus additional improvement techniques.

Valid for 2-D and 3-D analysis. \n\nValid values: VAL1 = 0, 1, 2, or 3. Default: VAL1 = 2 for 2-D analysis, VAL1 = 3 for 3-D analysis.\n\nVAL1 = 0 -- The mesh-sizing gradient is not retained. The new mesh is uniform and has an approximate average size on the entire remeshed domain(s), even if the original mesh has sizing gradients.\n\nVAL1 = 1 -- The new mesh follows the original mesh-sizing gradient to retain the element averaged-edge length. This value tends to coarsen the mesh in the location of the distorted elements during remeshing.\n\nVAL1 = 2 -- The new mesh follows the sizing gradient of the original mesh, with additional sizing compensation based on the element size change due to deformation during solution. This value tends to refine the mesh at the location of the distorted elements, where the distortion may have originated from deformation during solution.\n\nVAL1 = 3 -- Similar to VAL1 = 2, but assumes that perfect mesh quality is not required, thus avoiding over-refinement of minor distorted regions. Valid for 3-D analysis only. \n\nFor more information about this control, see [Gradient Control in the Nonlinear Adaptivity Analysis Guide](ans_nlad/advmnanewmesh.html#advmnlalocsizgrad).\n\n**QTOL **\n\n—\n\nThe new mesh-acceptance tolerance ([PLANE182](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE182.html), [PLANE222](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE222.html), [SOLID187](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID187.html), [SOLID227](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID227.html), and [SOLID285](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID285.html)).\n\nVAL1 – Controls remeshing to remove distortion. Default: 0.05.\n\nVAL2 – Controls element refinement. Default: 0.5.\n\nFor [PLANE182](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE182.html) and [PLANE222](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE222.html), VAL2 is the only valid option (for mesh refinement), and the new mesh is accepted when (MaxCornerAngleNew - MaxCornerAngleOld) / MaxCornerAngleOld = QTOL. \n\nFor [SOLID285](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID285.html), the new mesh is accepted when (SkewnessNew - SkewnessOld) / SkewnessOld = QTOL. \n\nFor [SOLID187](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID187.html) and [SOLID227](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID227.html), the new mesh is accepted when, in addition to skewness, (JacobianOld - JacobianNew) / JacobianOld = QTOL.\n\nThe program uses both tolerance and mesh-quality parameters to determine whether or not a new mesh is accepted.\n\nNot used in a [NLAD-ETCHG analysis](ans_nlad/ans_nlad_etchg.html).\n\n**REFA **\n\n—\n\nThe refinement algorithm adjustment ([PLANE182](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE182.html), [PLANE222](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE222.html), and [SOLID285](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID285.html)). Valid for 2-D and 3-D analysis.\n\nVAL1 – \n\nSPLIT – Use mesh [splitting](ans_nlad/advmnanewmesh.html#advsplitmorphgenmesh) instead of general remeshing. This is the only valid value.\n\nIf not specified, mesh refinement occurs via general remeshing (except for [PLANE183](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE183.html)).\n\nNot used in a [NLAD-ETCHG analysis](ans_nlad/ans_nlad_etchg.html).\n\n**TCOR**\n\n—\n\nCoordinate truncation adjustments for nodal locations of the meshes during remeshing. Valid for 2-D and 3-D analysis. \n\nVAL1 – \n\nON – Truncates the decimal value after the seventh position. Default behavior for [PLANE182](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE182.html), [PLANE222](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE222.html), and [SOLID285](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID285.html) (augmented Lagrange and penalty contact formulations only).\n\nOFF – No truncation occurs on the decimal value. Default behavior for [SOLID187](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID187.html) and [SOLID227](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID227.html) (all contact formulations), and [PLANE182](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE182.html) and [PLANE222](ans_elem/Hlp_E_PLANE222.html) (Lagrange multiplier contact formulation only).\n\n**AGGR**\n\n—\n\nAggressive remeshing option. Creates meshes with improved shape metrics. May change some global remeshing control parameters applied by other NLMESH commands, and may increase remeshing time. Valid for both 2-D and 3-D nonlinear adaptivity analysis.\n\nVAL1 – \n\nON – Enable aggressive remeshing.\n\nOFF – Disable aggressive remeshing (default).\n\n**LIST **\n\n—\n\nLists all mesh-quality control parameters.\n\nIf VAL1 has been specified for a given mesh control, the most recently specified value is listed.

Use AUTO to let ANSYS automatically choose the proper level of difficulty for the model. Lower values (1 or 2) generally provide the best performance for well-conditioned problems. Values of 3 or 4 generally provide the best performance for ill-conditioned problems; however, higher values may increase the solution time for well-conditioned problems.

Face nodes are listed in the order given for \"Surface Loads\" in the input data table for each element type in the [Element Reference](ans_elem/Hlp_E_ElemTOC.html). For example, for [SOLID185](ans_elem/Hlp_E_SOLID185.html), the item 1-JILK associates LKEY = 1 (face 1) with nodes J, I, L, and K. Surface load value VAL1 then applies to node J of face 1. To specify a table, enclose the table name in percent signs (%), for example, %tabname%. Use the [*DIM](ans_cmd/Hlp_C_DIM.html) command to define a table. Only one table can be specified, and it must be specified in the VAL1 position; tables specified in the VAL2, VAL3, or VAL4 positions will be ignored.

The port number must be an integer between 1 and 50. For an acoustic 2×2 transfer admittance matrix, the port number can be any positive integer. The smaller port number corresponds to port 1 of the 2×2 transfer admittance matrix, and the greater port number corresponds to port 2.
